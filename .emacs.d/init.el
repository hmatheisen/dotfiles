;;; init.el --- Emacs Init File

;;; Commentary:
;;; My Emacs Init File
;;; I first declare the scripts folder in which I store my personal scripts for Emacs
;;; Then the elisp folders contains package declaration/config and editor config

;;; Code:

;; MELPA
(package-initialize)
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
